The UNICODE-MATH package
========================

This package will provide a complete implementation of unicode maths for
XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.

While I am a little wary of encouraging people to use this package for
production work, I understand that it has certain uses and am making it
available for distribution. Your testing and feedback is essential to fill
in the many gaps that I miss!

Please be aware that this package is undergoing continued development and the
interface and functionality should not be considered completely stable. But
the more the package is used the more stable it will become. (Things are
generally working now; it is only minutiae that may change in the future.)

Unicode maths is currently supported by the following freely available fonts:

 - [Latin Modern Math][LM] (Bogusław Jackowski, Janusz M. Nowacki)
 - [TeX Gyre Pagella Math][PM] (Bogusław Jackowski, Janusz M. Nowacki)
 - [Asana Math][AM] (Apostolos Syropolous),
 - [Neo Euler][NE] (Khaled Hosny),
 - [STIX][SM] (STI Pub), and
 - [XITS Math][XM] (Khaled Hosny).

These fonts are available under open source licences
(the [GUST Font License][GFL] and [Open Font Licence][OFL]).

The following fonts are proprietary with OpenType maths support:

 - [Cambria Math][CM] (Microsoft),
 - [Minion Math][MM] (Johannes Küster, typoma GmbH)

I'm always looking for new fonts to test with, so please let me know of any
new releases.

PACKAGE USAGE
-------------

Please see the PDF documentation for full details. A simple beginning is:

    \usepackage{unicode-math}
    \setmathfont{xits-math.otf}

Most LaTeX math should still work after this. (Let me know if it doesn't.)
Furthermore, it will be in a different font.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

As well as running XeTeX or LuaTeX, this package requires recent versions of the `fontspec`, `expl3`, `xpackages`, `filehook`, `ucharcat`, and `lualatex-math` packages.
